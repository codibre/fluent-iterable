# Advanced examples

Here you'll find a collection of advanced examples of fluent usability!

- [Stream merging](stream-merging.md): How to merge multiple streams and treat errors with fluent;
- [Converting lists into dictionaries](list-to-dictionaries.md): It's better to get values from a dictionary rather than repeating finds in an array;
- [Combining iterables](combining-iterables.md): How to relate two distinct iterables in a faster manner;
- [Iterate over chunked streams seamlessly](iterate-chunks.md): Iterate over chunked streams like if you're dealing with simples lists!
- [Chain async and sync operations](combining-sync-and-async-operations.md): Chain sync and async operations over the fluent flow
- [Creating and validating unique lists](creating-and-validation-unique-list.md): How to generate unique lists or validate if an iterable is unique on the flow
- [Segregating responsibilities over](segregating-responsabilities-over.md): A elegant way to segregate responsibilities and orchestrate a iterable flow fluently, fit for a DDD, Onion o Hexagonal architecture!
- [Operators, resolvers and preparation](operators-and-resolvers.md): Understand how fluent iterable works under the hood, when the chained operations really happen and when is the best moment to resolve an iterable.
- [Nested flattening with back reference](nested-flattening-with-back-reference.md): Flat nested iterables keeping track of each level of items easily!
