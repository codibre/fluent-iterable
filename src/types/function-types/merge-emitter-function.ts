   * emission generates a new yielded result. The default key event is **'data'**.
   *
   * Also, the generated AsyncIterable will be infinite unless an ending event is emitted at some point.
   * The defaults ending events are **'end'** and **'close'**. So, it's important to have in mind this behavior
   * to use this feature properly. Operations that requires finiteness to be used may fall into an infinite loop.
   *
   * If you need to change the key event or other characteristics, you can do it through the **options** parameter
   * @param emitter The EventEmitter
   * @param options The EventEmitter options. Optional
   * @returns A new iterable that returns the elements of all others in the order of which resolves first
